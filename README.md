## Problem definition

You are required to design an algorithm that, based on the travel data of a potential airline 
customer (age, travel frequency, traveler type, preferred class, preferred destination, financial 
means, and the possibility of traveling with children), determines the most suitable fare type: 
- If the customer is a minor and takes at least 6 flights per year, the fare offered should 
be “Pajarillo” (with a 10% discount off the flight price). 
- If the customer is between 18 and 25 years old and is studying at a university in another 
city, traveling in economy class from their family home at least once a month during the 
academic months between both cities, they should be offered the "Gorrión" fare (with 
a 15% discount off the flight price). 

- If the customer is between 18 and 25 years old, has started working but still lives with 
their parents, and takes at least three leisure trips a year in economy class, they should 
be offered the "Travel While You Can" fare (with a 5% discount off the flight price); on 
the other hand, if they no longer live with their parents, they should be offered the 
"Daring to Leave the Nest" fare (with a 25% discount off the flight price). 
- If the customer is over 25 years old, has an income above €20,000 but less than €35,000, 
and takes at least 6 trips a year in economy class to destinations within Europe, they 
may be offered the "Discover Europe" fare (with a 15% discount off the flight price); and 
if traveling with children (under 12 years old), they may be offered the "Discover Europe 
with Your Little Ones" fare (with a 10% discount off each ticket). 
- If the customer is over 25 years old, has an income above €35,000, and takes at least 6 
trips a year in business class to destinations in Asia or America, they may be offered the 
"Discover the World" fare (with a 20% discount off the flight price); and if traveling with 
children (under 12 years old), they may be offered the "Discover the World with Your 
Little Ones" fare (with a 10% discount off each ticket). 
It is assumed that no ambiguities exist regarding the type of offer that may be extended to a 
given customer. If any ambiguities are found, please write the assumptions and exceptions you 
consider most appropriate.
